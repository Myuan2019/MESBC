# Mutually Exclusive Spectral Biclustering (MESBC) 

There are two files provided for MESBC analysis: 

The "MESBC sample.Rdata" contains a simulated example of gene expression count data with five biclusters with the following size: 20×20, 50×20, 50×20, 30×40, and 100×50. It was assumed that the non-bicluster elements (i.e., the background noise) were randomly generated from a negative binomial distribution with a mean of mu0, and the elements within biclusters were sampled from a negative binomial distribution with a mean of mu.

The "code for MESBC analysis.R" contains the R code for analysis. 

Please load the sample Rdata file first and then do the analysis.
